# Spotify-Recommender-System
The goal of creating our music recommender system 
is to personalise recommendations to users based on their listening 
history and preferences. Our approach will focus on playlist 
continuation by suggesting songs that a user may enjoy based on the 
current songs in their playlist. One major issue with the Million
Playlist Dataset (MPD) is scalability and lack of content features. 
To solve these issues, we will use a Clustering Neural Collaborative 
Filtering method for our main recommender system and measure its 
effectiveness by comparing its performance to a non-personalised, 
popularity based method using RMSE, Hit@K ratio and NDCG as 
evaluation metrics.

Note: this repository only shows the code as the Million Playlist Dataset is too large to attach
